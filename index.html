    <P> <em>
        Coffee offers several potential health benefits,
         primarily due to its caffeine and antioxidant content. 
         These benefits can include <br>increased energy and alertness,
          improved physical performance, enhanced cognitive function, 
          and a lower risk of certain diseases like type 2 
          diabetes, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's.
